# NAIST Thesis Template

This is yet another LaTeX template for NAIST theses based on up-to-date Word/PDF templates published <a href="http://isw3.naist.jp/IS/Local/IsOffice/announce/thesis-master-eng.html">here</a> (authentication required).
There are other LaTeX templates made by students (such as <a href="https://github.com/kmiya/naist-thesis-tmpl-en">this</a>), but they are apparently outdated.

The layout, packages,  etc. are defined in `naist.sty`.
Imported packages and new commands are limited to minimum, so that you can add packages by yourself without conflicts.

## Note on Japanese Template:
Use LaTex compiler instead of pdfLaTex compiler. If you are using Overleaf, pdfLaTex is the default compiler. You can change it on the `menu` of Overleaf's page.
